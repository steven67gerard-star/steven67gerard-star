- 👋 Hi, I’m @steven67gerard-star
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code, I learned at a young age to keep my friends close, and keep my enemies closer. After getting my website, computer, and phone hacked, I want to learn how to actively defend myself.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything I can. If I were to be ranked by experience level on a K-12 scale, I just graduated pre-school
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a de-centralized business platform that can be automated and function monetarily apart from a centralized bank and secure enough to be no-KYC
- 📫 How to reach me at this point is through this GitHub program until I learn secure ways to communicate directly
- 😄 Pronouns: ...
- ⚡ Fun fact: By trade I am a carpenter, I also have an Architect degree, combining those two, I love to design and build breathe-taking dream kitchens, and I want to custom build, or stack applications to automate a website, preferably using AI (I have a great idea) so I can take care of people who want kitchen cabinetry
